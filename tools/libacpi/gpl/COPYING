INBOUND LICENSE

Contributions to this directory are made under the LGPLv2.1 *only* as
described in the COPYING file of the parent directory. As LGPLv2.1 is
compatible with the GPLv2, the resulting file is GPLv2 when seen as a
whole.

The intention of this inbound license, is to avoid having to ask
subsequent contributors to this directory for permission to change the
license from GPLv2 to LGPLv2.1, once we get permission from the
remaining copyright holders of this directory to change the license to
LGPLv2.1.

Note: The only outstanding permission required to re-license this
directory to LGPLv2.1 is from Lenovo.
