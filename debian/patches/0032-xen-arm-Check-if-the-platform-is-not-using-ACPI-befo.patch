Subject: xen/arm: Check if the platform is not using ACPI before initializing
 Dom0less

Dom0less requires a device-tree. However, since commit 6e3e77120378
"xen/arm: setup: Relocate the Device-Tree later on in the boot", the
device-tree will not get unflatten when using ACPI.

This will lead to a crash during boot.

Given the complexity to setup dom0less with ACPI (for instance how to
assign device?), we should skip any code related to Dom0less when using
ACPI.
