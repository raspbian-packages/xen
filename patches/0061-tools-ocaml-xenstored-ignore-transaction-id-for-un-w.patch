Subject: tools/ocaml/xenstored: ignore transaction id for [un]watch
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Instead of ignoring the transaction id for XS_WATCH and XS_UNWATCH
commands as it is documented in docs/misc/xenstore.txt, it is tested
for validity today.

Really ignore the transaction id for XS_WATCH and XS_UNWATCH.

This is part of XSA-115.
