PCI vendor ID 0x5853 has been reserved for use by Xen systems in order to
advertise certain virtual hardware to guest virtual machines. The primary
use of this is with device ID 0x0001 to advertise the Xen Platform PCI
device - the presence of this virtual device enables a guest Operating
System (subject to the availability of suitable drivers) to make use of
paravirtualisation features such as disk and network devices etc.

Some Xen vendors wish to provide alternative and/or additional guest drivers
that can bind to virtual devices. This may be done using the Xen PCI vendor
ID of 0x5853 and Xen-vendor/device specific PCI device IDs. This file
records reservations made within the device ID range in order to avoid
multiple Xen vendors using conflicting IDs.

Guidelines
 1. A vendor may request a range of device IDs by submitting a patch to
    this file.
 2. Vendor allocations should be in the range 0xc000-0xfffe to reduce the
    possibility of clashes with community IDs assigned from the bottom up.
 3. The vendor is responsible for allocations within the range and should
    try to record specific device IDs in PCI ID databases such as
    http://pciids.sourceforge.net and http//www.pcidatabase.com
